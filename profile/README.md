Development Seed is "open by default." 

We work with open-source technology to make the tools we build and use more broadly accessible. We collaborate with organizations and communities eager to address some of the world's most challenging problems. Take a look at some of our pinned repositories to get a sense of what we do.

## Get Involved

It is no accident that open source is at the core of our business strategy. With over 500 public GitHub repositories, we firmly believe in making things people can share and reuse. By utilizing open components, this approach aggregates software investments into a collective public good. By adopting open licensing, we provide flexibility in tool utilization instead of burdening organizations with software license fees. At the heart of it all, we take immense pride in our work, always eager to present, share, and learn. We're not just creating software; we're fostering a community. We invite you to use our work, contribute to projects that resonate with you, and join us on this open-source journey.
