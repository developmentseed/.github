Development Seed is "open by default." We work with open-source technology to make the tools we build and use more broadly accessible.

## Get Involved

We collaborate with organizations and communities eager to address some of the world's most challenging problems. Take a look at some of our pinned repositories to get a sense of what we do. Want to make a contribution? Make a pull request!
